<h1>
    OUR VALUES
</h1>
<h2>
    Fashion is interdisciplinary.
</h2>
<p>
    Thread is a fashion magazine that acts like a design organization,
    thought platform, and artistic collective. We look to explore and
    showcase the breadth of creativity at Cornell.
</p>
<h2>
    Thread doesn't have one "look"  .
</h2>
<p>
    Fashion encompasses many faces and we strive to do the same. We go
    beyond the boundaries of 'trendy' and 'stylish', using apparel as
    a medium of expression to mark cultural conversations.
</p>
<h2>
    Thread redefines beauty.
</h2>
<p>
    We see hair and makeup as physical manifestations of human feeling,
    emotion and experience. Beauty is dynamic and multi-faceted, far
    beyond the makeup brushes and curling irons.
</p>
<h2>
    Design with purpose.
</h2>
<p>
    We translate visual inspirations into paper medium, evoking and
    enhancing thematic elements in every decision, making this magazine
    not only a publication but a work of art.
